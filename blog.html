                    10/1/2025 - I messed around with HTML during class. It's pretty cool. 
                    I think I'll add what I did seperate from the assignment. 
                    It seems annoying having to worry about all the tags.

                    10/2/2025 - I set everything up, started answer questions. This doesn't seem too hard. In fact, I'd call this easy.
                     I plan to give each page it's own theme song. I think that's funny and also fun.
                     Do I have to add in br's to stuff here or will it automatically squish down? I think I'll have to add br's.
                     <br>Nope just check it and it does keep everything to one screen length which is a good formatting thing but might just be the browser though I don't really care if that's the case yet.
                     <br>Am I supposed to add the links in a seperate git-push? Does it matter? I think I'll remove, push, add & push them. That'll be funny. 
                     <br>I don't know how I'll merge the main website folder with the assignments. I guess manually? It seems like a pain. Though I guess that makes each assignment a website snapshot.
