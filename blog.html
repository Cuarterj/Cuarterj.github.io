                    10/1/2025 - I messed around with HTML during class. It's pretty cool. 
                    I think I'll add what I did seperate from the assignment. 
                    It seems annoying having to worry about all the tags.

                    10/2/2025 - I set everything up, started answer questions. This doesn't seem too hard. In fact, I'd call this easy.
                     I plan to give each page it's own theme song. I think that's funny and also fun.
                     Do I have to add in br's to stuff here or will it automatically squish down? I think I'll have to add br's.
                     <br>Nope just check it and it does keep everything to one screen length which is a good formatting thing but might just be the browser though I don't really care if that's the case yet.
                     <br>Am I supposed to add the links in a seperate git-push? Does it matter? I think I'll remove, push, add & push them. That'll be funny. 
                     <br>I don't know how I'll merge the main website folder with the assignments. I guess manually? It seems like a pain. Though I guess that makes each assignment a website snapshot.

                    10/13/25 - Learned more about CSS in class today, so I've added some boxes and colors and stuff. Very intersting, I can't wait to improve the website past this intiial phase.

                <p>I feel like I don't really have anything to write here for the reflection. I didn't have any troubles with the assignment, though formatting CSS seems like it requires a concentrated effort for page elements to look good. If I didn't know how to do something I would just look at it and then I would be good.</p>
                <p>In this assignment I learned HTML and how to make a page, and in class I've learned CSS and added a bunch of things without bothering to make it look nice. I find that amusing but I'm worried if my chaotic webpage may be unprofessional for a classroom setting and negatively affect me.</p>
                <p>One of the resources on the website had lots of basic HTML things which were good. I also used GeeksForGeeks & W3SChool a few times I think for just answering whatever random questions I had about how to do something. I diddn't credit the websites since it's all basic kinds of information. </p>

                    I've completed the assignment, and I think what I've taken away from this is that CSS and making things look pretty sucks and is completly bothersome.
                    <br> I know that things will probably get easier with knowledge but for this assignment I found that not knowing how to do things means I have to experiment with finnicky things and guess how to do things to correctly make things look the way they're supposed to.
                    <br> Flex boxes are a lot more versatile than I thought. End comment.
                    <br> At the conception copying a mockup is annoying. The only real error I know I've made is something with the filter boxes. I think some kind of padding/margin/border or whatever is making the min box go too far right and that there's 3 things that are kind of similar is super sucks.
                    <br> Although I didn't like it, I feel like intellectually I can tell that none of this is that hard, and is actually remarkably easy with how elements can have ids or whatnot to directly change their looks. This assignment definetly helps show off how powerful CSS can be.
                    <br> The only real resources I used was the in-lecture code, since everything shown wa pretty 1-to-1 in implementation. Though, I did google a few things stupid things. Like how to do Border & how to change text thickness. There's a lot of things possible and the best way for me to describe it is 'overwhelming'.
